## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
```clarity
subscriptions -> Active recurring payment schedules
user-stats    -> Payment history and statistics
```

### Payment Flow
1. **Create**: Subscriber sets up recurring payment
2. **Schedule**: Next payment automatically calculated
3. **Process**: Anyone can trigger due payments
4. **Repeat**: Cycle continues until cancelled

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Service Providers

1. **Receive Subscriptions**: Users create subscriptions to pay you
2. **Monitor Payments**: Track incoming recurring revenue
3. **Process Payments**: Trigger payment processing when due

### For Subscribers

1. **Create Subscription**: Set up recurring payments
   ```clarity
   (create-subscription recipient amount interval-blocks)
   ```

2. **Monitor Status**: Track payment schedules and history
3. **Update/Cancel**: Modify or stop subscriptions anytime
   ```clarity
   (update-subscription-amount subscription-id new-amount)
   (cancel-subscription subscription-id)
   ```

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Monthly Service Subscription
```
1. Alice subscribes to Bob's newsletter: 5 STX every 30 days
2. Payment automatically processes every month
3. Bob receives 4.9875 STX (5 STX - 0.25% fee)
4. Continues until Alice or Bob cancels
```

### Flexible Payment Updates
```
1. Charlie creates 10 STX weekly subscription to Dave's service
2. After 3 payments, Charlie updates to 15 STX weekly
3. Next payment processes 15 STX instead of 10 STX
4. Payment history tracks both amounts
```

### Subscription Cancellation
```
1. Eve subscribes to Frank's premium service: 20 STX bi-weekly
2. After 2 months, Eve cancels subscription
3. No further payments are processed
4. Frank can see final payment statistics
```
